## Why I learn this course?
I reference repo name from MIT OCW course by Professor John Tsitsiklis, 2010. I want to use this space to express my gratitude toward him, I graduated from Statistics major, but know very little about probability and statistics. I had studied statistical theory before and it's like a myth for me, I could not interpret that mathematical notation and convert it into intuition, in the end I could not apply it to real world problem. Once I started my career as data analyst, I have a feeling of being an unqualified amatuer statistician so on 2021, five years later, I come back to this field to `relearn` the skillset that I should have. This course change my perspective on how to form the problem along with some basic calculation.

## What is this repo for?
My plan is to store what I learn along with python/R code here. For me, If I only learn without practicing it, in the end, I could not apply this knowledge into my day-to-day work. I might consider learning `Introduction to Statistical learning` to be able to do analysis from what I've studied.
